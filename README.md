# cman

cman is a configurable two-level cache (for caching Objects).

It has two levels:
* level 1: memory cache;
* level 2: filesystem.

cman allows to specify different cache strategies and max sizes of level 1 and 2 caches.


The initial task looks as follows:
> "Create a configurable two-level cache (for caching Objects).
Level 1 is memory, level 2 is filesystem.
Config params should let one specify the cache strategies and max sizes of level 1 and 2."
